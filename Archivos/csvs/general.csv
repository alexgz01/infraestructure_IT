Although high seroprevalence could have been expected to trigger herd immunity and prevent further waves in the state, we have observed persistent levels of infection after the first wave and eventually the emergence of a second viral strain just before an augmented second wave. Our experiments suggest that the persistent levels of infection after the first wave may be due to reinfection, whereas the higher peak at the second wave can be explained by the emergence of the second variant and a low level of cross-immunity between the original and the second variant. Finally, the proposed model provides insights into the effect of reinfection and cross-immunity on the long-term spread of an unmitigated epidemic.",2021,,"1706804,1827892,1392844523,2081135","E.

649def34f8be52c8b66281af98ae884c09aef38b,Construction of the Literature Graph in Semantic Scholar,"We describe a deployed scalable system for organizing published scientific literature into a heterogeneous graph to facilitate algorithmic manipulation and discovery. The resulting literature graph consists of more than 280M nodes, representing papers, authors, entities and various interactions between them (e.g., authorships, citations, entity mentions). We reduce literature graph construction into familiar NLP tasks (e.g., entity extraction and linking), point out research challenges due to differences from standard formulations of these tasks, and report empirical results for each task. The methods described in this paper are used to enable semantic features in www.semanticscholar.org.",2018,,"145585097,3458736,1857797,46181066,46230609,145612610,38092776,143718836,46411828,4480314,143967880,41018147,46258841,144240185,46256862,39139825,39561369,46181683,31860505,46212260,2112339497,15292561,1741101","Waleed Ammar,Dirk Groeneveld,Chandra Bhagavatula,Iz Beltagy,Miles Crawford,Doug Downey,Jason Dunkelberger,Ahmed Elgohary,Sergey Feldman,Vu A.

2038383fedccdf0b8c1efcb0832ecd18b481b3c1,Overview of Big Data and Its Visualization,"Big Data is data sets that are so voluminous and complex that traditional data processing application software are inadequate to deal with them. This chapter discusses what Big Data is and its characteristics, and how this information revolution of Big Data is transforming our lives and the new technology and methodologies that have been developed to process data of these huge dimensionalities. This chapter discusses the components of the Big Data stack interface, categories of Big Data analytics software and platforms, descriptions of the top 20 Big Data analytics software. Big Data visualization techniques are discussed with real data from fatality analysis reporting system (FARS) managed by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the United States Department of Transportation. Big Data web-based visualization software are discussed that are both JavaScript-based and user-interface-based. This chapter also discusses the challenges and opportunities of using Big Data and presents a flow diagram of the 30 chapters within this handbook.",2022,,"3128073,2052804160","R. Segall,G. Niu"

The goal of artificial intelligence in the medical field is to assist doctors and health care workers in diagnosing diseases and clinical treatment, reducing the rate of medical error, and saving lives of citizens. The main and widely used technologies are expert systems, machine learning and big data. In the article, a brief overview of the three mentioned techniques will be provided to make it easier for readers to understand these techniques and their importance.",2022,,"1394846990,2149322954,21366673,2061630849,2156915219","Maad M.
